1) After running the code, an empty board will appear with prompt asking for the input, for that enter any position for e.g. 0 1 or 2 1 or 1 1 or 1 2 and you will be assigned to that position
2) After you entered the first player position, you have to enter the second player position by the same above method and play the game as you play tic tac toe normally like this.

Note: If you think we can make this even good then feel free to reach me out and we will make this more interactive.

Thank you for reading!!

Have a good one!ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ
